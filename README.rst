===============================

GeoText extracts countries, nationalities, states and cities mentions from text.

It gets a block of text as input and produces a tuple of `Place` objects as a result respresenting detected countries, nationalities, states and cities.

Each `Place` object has the following fields:
    `name`: name of the palce, e.g. 'London', 'New York' for cities; 'France', 'Germany' for countries, etc.
    `population`: number of people living in this place, available only for cities and countries

Also there're additional place-specific fields.
`City` has:
    `state`: (optional, None by default) a `State` object representing region of the city, e.g. "State: California, United States"
    `country`: a `Country` (`Place`) object of this city

`State` has:
    `country`: a `Country` (`Place`) object of this state/region

`geography
<https://github.com/ushahidi/geograpy>`_: geography is more advanced and bigger in scope compared to geotext and can do everything geotext does. On the other hand geotext is leaner: has no external dependencies, is faster (re vs nltk) and also depends on libraries and data covered with more permissive licenses.
